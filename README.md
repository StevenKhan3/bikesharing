# Bikesharing with Citi Bike 

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to take the data given from Citi Bike and turn it into a set of a consumable data visualizations that can communicate patterns in the data to a general audience. To do this we've utilized Pandas with Jupyter Notebook and Tableau.

The analysis begins with a basic overview of the data which contains a map of the top starting locations for rides in NYC and a pie chart showing the gender distribution of riders. This dashboard is intended to provide a basic overview of the data.

Total user checkout times are then shown, which is then followed by the same graph filtered by gender. This line graph showcased the large disparity in Male and Female ridership.

Total trips by weekday are visualized as a heatmap. The majority of Monday-Friday trips are 7 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM. When filtering this heatmap by Gender, it is again found that Male ridership far outpaces Female ridership. However, the peak riding hours across all genders are similar.

Finally, user trips by gender is visualized. This chart illustrates that users are much more likely to be subscribers, rather than ordinary customers.

## Summary  
The majority of Citi Bike users are Males that use the service from 7am and 5-6pm. This makes sense because these are the times that most people are commuting to work. In major cities many communters run in to the issue of getting off public transport and still having to walk and Citi Bike could be the solution to this problem.

### Additional Suggestions
One suggestion that could be made is the starting areas based on user types, this can give useful insight on what areas have subscribers vs customers and what areas they could advertise subscriptions to inorder to have more longterm customers. 

Another investigaton could be the correlation between gender and location to see which genders are using Citi Bike in what areas, this can help know what audience needs to be advertised too.
